// Which bridge answers for a conversation. Blip ships ONE source, the Mac, and
// every conversation id routes to it — iMessage is the only source Blip ships,
// tests and answers bug reports for. The seam exists so a fork can add a second
// source by adding an entry to EXTRA_SOURCES, without re-deriving a spawn at
// every call site (#70). It is not a plugin system and carries no guarantees
// beyond "stock Blip resolves exactly as it did before".
//
// Pure (no fs) so the QML renderer and the TypeScript spawners agree on one
// answer. Rebuild the QML module:
//   bun build source-id.ts --target browser --format esm --outfile SourceId.mjs

# Development log

## 2026-09-15 — Match the app before focusing or closing a window

- Restrict the documented Super+M shortcut and the app IPC focus command to
  `org.quickshell` windows titled exactly `Blip` or `Blip (N)`. An unrelated
  browser/editor titled “Blip documentation” must not be focused or closed.
- Preserve the documented toggle behavior for the real app, the bounded map
  wait, and compositor-based lookup after a shell hot-reload.
- Verification: 535 Bun tests pass; the eight new shell-command regression
  cases all fail against the original implementation. Tests execute the actual
  README/QML commands with synthetic client metadata and intercepted dispatch,
  IPC and sleep commands. Plugin validation and whitespace checks pass.
- Existing users must replace their copied keybinding to receive the shortcut
  correction. No real conversations were opened or messages sent for testing;
  no layout changes or live shell restart were needed.

## 2026-09-15 — Message context menu and quotation replies

- Right-clicking plain message text offers Quote and reply and Copy message.
  Right-clicking a link or link preview offers only Open in browser, Copy link
  and Share link; the existing QR code and LocalSend sheet is retained.
- Quoting preserves the current draft, returns typing focus to the composer,
  and does not send. The keyboard shortcut uses the same formatter. Empty or
  withdrawn messages cannot be quoted; link-only messages use the URL. Long
  excerpts show an ellipsis and do not split Unicode code points.
- Link and message menus were visually rechecked after separating their actions;
  hidden actions are disabled so keyboard navigation skips them.
- Menu focus blocks the panel navigation catcher. Changing conversations
  closes the menu so actions cannot target a previous conversation.
- Verification: 532 source tests pass; the menu passes qmllint. Synthetic
  Quickshell checks and grim screenshots cover wide/narrow menus, keyboard
  selection, quotation with an existing draft, restored composer focus, and
  the existing share sheet. No real messages were read or sent for testing.
- Deployed only the menu changes onto the existing installed code, preserving
  unrelated local changes. After shell restart IPC reports online and healthy,
  and recent shell logs contain no Blip warnings/errors. Installed-copy tests:
  489 pass, four pre-existing failures involving old installer files and
  release-documentation versions, reproduced with this patch reversed.
- Limitation: quotation replies are ordinary messages, not Apple inline reply
  threads. The change is deployed locally and prepared for upstream review.

## 2026-09-14 — Stay on the last workspace after a walk-away

- Idle, screensaver and display-off remake the shell window on the focused
  workspace. The earlier restore only covered a shell restart, and then
  treated that remap as a new home.
- Keep a live-title compositor rule for the last real workspace. Save a new
  home only from a user window move. A remap or monitor churn is returned
  silently, without focus.
- Verification: 487 TypeScript tests passed, including the home rule,
  move-vs-remap decision and silent return. Deployed onto this machine and
  restarted the shell from another workspace: the window came back on
  workspace 2, unfocused, IPC online and healthy. A compositor move off
  workspace 2 was returned there by the silent-home path. Full idle-cycle
  confirmation remains with the user.
- Known limitation: a compositor that reports a user-looking `movewindow`
  during display-off can still be adopted as a new home; the live rule is
  the backstop for the usual close-and-reopen remap.

## 2026-09-07 — Upstream composer update

- Updated the installed plugin to upstream ba1d8f9 (manifest 2.3.3), including the fix that keeps the cursor visible after a draft exceeds the composer height.
- Updated the Mac imsg tool to the matching upstream version and restarted the shell.
- Earlier local merged-conversation changes are included upstream; preserved the installed diff in a Git stash before updating. No additional application patch was needed.
- Verification: 391 TypeScript tests and 48 Mac-tool Python tests passed; synthetic drafts wrapped to 18 lines in the wide view and 26 in the narrow view, scrolled to the cursor, and shrank to one line when cleared. Inspected the synthetic narrow-view screenshot. Installed tests passed again; runtime reported online, healthy, and push enabled; Mac tool checksum matched.
- No real messages were read or sent during testing. Visual confirmation in the user's normal session remains with the user.

## 2026-09-07 — Restore the app on its last workspace

- Remember the window's actual workspace, including moves while unfocused. Restore an open window there without initial focus; leave closed windows closed. Explicit launches remain available.
- Prepare placement before mapping through a narrowly matched, unique restoration title and one replaceable runtime compositor rule. No permanent workspace rule or user configuration is required by the application. A missing old workspace field falls back to quiet placement on the current workspace. A failed preparation leaves automatic restoration closed.
- Wait for compositor metadata before identifying the shell's own window; never match another process by title alone. Persist no conversation data.
- Verification: 394 tests passed. An isolated window restored on workspace 4, followed a manual move to 5 on its next restart without changing the active workspace, and stayed closed after closing and restarting.
- Removed the earlier fixed-workspace workaround. The existing window had already recorded workspace 2 during deployment. A live shell restart from workspace 3 restored Blip on workspace 2, unfocused, with healthy IPC; all 394 installed tests passed. This patch is local pending upstream submission.
